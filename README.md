## I have coded the existing design with React.js
Feel free to use the code!
## What you will find?
I have seperated all components in different files with their names.
And in file you can find the component code and in css file styles of the component itself,
you can copy only that componenet and modyfi it as you wish. I know it might look to simple for some of you 
or to complicated, but hey nothing will be perfect at the start. For newbies : Don't give up you can make it!
